backend:
- hook request events on creation of passengers
- add a nested router
- correct search filter url
- make global string file
- don't show full rides
- rename views to correspond tests
- remove old rides periodically??
- private ride authentication
- first_name and last_name in user model
- divide user and profile functionality to its own django app
- divide serializers to its own folder
- convert primary keys to slugs/strings
- hyperlinking
- go through tests again and reorganize
- revisit api root
- write docs

client:
- add backend url to config: 10.0.2.2
- add default pictures and values, when not loaded
- one single container for gathered data?
- find a better place for the footer
- make my-rides tabs to own components

decisions:
- are old rides automatically set to 'completed'?
